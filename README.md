# Java FX SQLite Quiz

A simple SQLite quiz list application developed with FX and Java.

This project developed with Java Generics, Java FX, SQLite.

The Java FX SQLite Quiz is an innovative and efficient quiz list application developed using Java FX and SQLite. This project leverages the power of Java Generics, Java FX, and SQLite to provide a flawless experience for managing quizs. Through its intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), users can easily create, update, and delete for quizs.

One of the key features of this application is its seamless integration of JavaFX and SQLite. By utilizing the JavaFX SQLite API, the application ensures efficient data management by creating a smooth communication channel between the JavaFX user interface and the underlying SQLite database. This integration enables swift data retrieval and manipulation, providing users with real-time updates on their quiz list.

Moreover, the JavaFX JDBC SQLite driver utilized in this project enables seamless connectivity between the JavaFX application and the SQLite database. This capability ensures that the quiz list application can easily interact with the database, executing queries, and performing CRUD operations without compromising efficiency or data integrity.

The application's primary focus is on providing a user-friendly and visually appealing quiz list experience. With its sleek and modern design, users can effortlessly navigate through various features, such as adding a new quiz, editing existing quiz details, and deleting unwanted quizs.

This JavaFX application also serves as a valuable example for developers looking for guidance on building their own quiz list applications. The meticulously crafted codebase showcases best practices in implementing JavaFX components, handling user input, and effectively utilizing Java Generics to create a flexible and scalable solution.
